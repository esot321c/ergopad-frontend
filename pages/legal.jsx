                board members who decide how to utilize funds and which projects to launch on ErgoPad. This 
                DAO also appoints a CEO, CTO, and CMO to run ErgoPad on a day-to-day basis, but keeps a close 
                eye on the projects and votes on any major decisions when necessary. 
            </Typography>

            <Typography variant="p">
                As a decentralized organization, the DAO does not fall under any one country's legal 
                jurisdiction. With that in mind, an investment in ErgoPad requires that you place your 
                trust in the actions of the board members. Each board member is motivated by an appreciation 
                for the tech behind Ergo, and a desire to see the ecosystem thrive. The DAO will always 
                strive to follow the philosophies laid out in the <MuiNextLink id="manifesto-01" 
                href="https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2021-04-26-the-ergo-manifesto/" target="_blank">Ergo Manifesto</MuiNextLink>.
            </Typography>

            <Typography variant="p">
                Legally speaking, because of the organization of the DAO, there will be no corporation to 
                sue if you are unhappy with the results of an IDO. An investment in any token launched by 
                ErgoPad has the potential to go to zero. By interacting with the smart contracts on 
                the Ergo blockchain through this website, you accept full responsibility for your decisions 
                and agree to not hold the members of the DAO responsible for the price changes in the open 
                market.
